Migrating a web application from Azure to AWS and gradually shifting traffic to ensure a smooth transition involves several strategic steps.
Below is a roadmap that outlines the steps you should take and how to manage this process using DevOps practices.

### Roadmap for Gradual Traffic Migration from Azure to AWS

#### 1. Preparation and Initial Setup

1. **Assess Current Application:**
   - Inventory all components of your 1mg web application on Azure.
   - Identify dependencies, performance requirements, and potential bottlenecks.

2. **Set Up AWS Environment:**
   - Create an AWS account if you don’t have one.
   - Set up the necessary AWS services such as EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, VPC, and others relevant to your application.
   - Use Terraform  automate infrastructure setup(terraform because it is multi cloud IAS tool).

3. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Define IAM roles and policies.
   - Ensure data encryption in transit and at rest using AWS KMS.
   - Set up AWS Config and Security Hub for compliance monitoring.

#### 2. Application Migration

1. **Data Migration:**
   - Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for database migration.
   - Ensure data consistency and integrity during the migration.

2. **Application Deployment:**
   - Containerize the application using Docker if it’s not already containerized.
   - Deploy the application to AWS using ECS/EKS or directly to EC2 instances.
   - Use AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodeCommit for CI/CD.

3. **Network Configuration:**
   - Set up AWS VPC, subnets, security groups, and route tables.
   - Configure Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling Groups.

#### 3. Traffic Management

1. **Set Up DNS and Traffic Routing:**
   - Use AWS Route 53 for DNS management.
   - Implement weighted routing to distribute 20% of traffic to AWS and 80% to Azure.

2. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the application on AWS (functional, performance, security).
   - Monitor performance using CloudWatch, X-Ray, and third-party tools like Datadog.

#### 4. Gradual Traffic Shift and Monitoring

1. **Monitor Initial Traffic Shift:**
   - Begin with a small percentage (20%) of traffic routed to AWS.
   - Monitor application performance and user experience closely.

2. **Health Checks and Failover:**
   - Implement health checks to ensure the AWS deployment is functioning correctly.
   - Plan for failover to Azure in case of issues with the AWS environment.

3. **Incremental Traffic Increase:**
   - Gradually increase traffic to AWS in increments (e.g., 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%) over time.
   - Continuously monitor and validate application performance at each step.

#### 5. Full Cutover and Post-Migration

1. **Complete Traffic Shift:**
   - Once confident in the AWS environment, switch 100% of traffic to AWS.
   - Decommission Azure resources or repurpose them as needed.

2. **Post-Migration Optimization:**
   - Optimize AWS resources for cost and performance using Trusted Advisor, Cost Explorer, and Auto Scaling.
   - Implement additional AWS services for enhanced functionality (e.g., CloudFront for CDN, WAF for security).

3. **Documentation and Training:**
   - Document the entire migration process, architecture, and any operational procedures.
   - Train your team on managing and maintaining the AWS environment.

### Detailed DevOps Implementation

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define and manage your infrastructure.
   - Maintain version-controlled IaC scripts in a Git repository.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Use AWS CodePipeline for the overall orchestration of your CI/CD pipeline.
   - Integrate CodeBuild for build processes and CodeDeploy for deploying applications.
   - Use CodeCommit or GitHub for source code management.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up CloudWatch for monitoring application performance and infrastructure health.
   - Use CloudTrail for logging and auditing AWS API calls.
   - Integrate third-party tools like Datadog or Splunk for enhanced monitoring and alerting.

4. **Automated Testing:**
   - Implement automated testing (unit, integration, performance) as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Use tools like Selenium for functional testing and JMeter for performance testing.

5. **Blue/Green Deployment:**
   - Use blue/green deployment strategy to reduce downtime and risk.
   - Deploy the new version of the application to a separate environment (green) while the current version (blue) remains live.
   - Switch traffic to the green environment after successful testing.

6. **Feature Flags:**
   - Implement feature flags to control the rollout of new features and perform A/B testing.
   - Use tools like LaunchDarkly or AWS AppConfig for feature flag management.

### Example Steps for Weighted Routing with Route 53

1. **Create a Hosted Zone:**
   - Set up a hosted zone in Route 53 for your domain.

2. **Configure Record Sets:**
   - Create A/AAAA records for your Azure and AWS instances.
   - Set up weighted routing policies to distribute traffic (e.g., 80% Azure, 20% AWS).

3. **Adjust Weights Gradually:**
   - Modify the weights over time to gradually shift more traffic to AWS.

### Example Terraform Script for Weighted Routing

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_route53_zone" "main" {
  name = "example.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "azure" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "app.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "60"

  weighted_routing_policy {
    weight = 80
  }

  records = ["<Azure_IP_Address>"]
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "aws" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "app.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "60"

  weighted_routing_policy {
    weight = 20
  }

  records = ["<AWS_IP_Address>"]
}
```
